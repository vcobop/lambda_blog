This is a blog with personal notes about some popular programs that i have been using that are popular in bioinformatic, as well as guides for common tasks in bioinformatic.
We can learn together, I gonna share with you the way that I been learning for use diferent programms or the way that i find more usefull for common tasks in bioinformatic scripts. I have realiced that the documentation not always is usefull for all the people or some programs don't have anymore a support, specially if in all the cases, depend the level of knowledge that we have of how work a structure of computer, the common lenguage between programmers or things that supposed we already have, Finally, I think that this had be usefull when I search in internet many of the typical begginner bioinformatic problems.
